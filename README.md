# Chat Application 💬

A real-time chat application built using Java and socket programming. It facilitates seamless communication between a server and client over a network.

## Features ✅

- **Real-Time Communication**: Client can send and receive messages instantly.
- **Robust Communication**: Handles message delivery and error scenarios effectively.
- **Simple Interface**: Command-line-based chat for ease of use.
- **Custom Protocols**: Implements basic messaging protocols for reliable communication.

## Tech Stack 🛠️

- **Programming Language**: Java
- **Networking**: Java Sockets (`java.net` package)

## How It Works ⚙️

1. **Server**: 
   - Listens for incoming connections on a specific port.
   - Manages communication with connected clients using threads.

2. **Client**:
   - Connects to the server using its IP and port.
   - Sends and receives messages in real-time.

## Future Enhancements 🚀
- Add feature for multiple clients connected to single server.
- Add a GUI using JavaFX or Swing for an enhanced user experience.
- Implement message encryption for secure communication.
- Add support for file sharing between clients.
